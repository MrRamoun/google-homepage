# Google Logo Redesign by: **R}AM#UN>**

## Inspiration

At the Beginnning I was thinking of somehting rectilinear so i only used rectancles then i added circles with the same width as the rectangles and tried to use them 
to Write the word "bold" then "google" (notice how the 'G' is so small and ugly ;).

## Cutting Edges

I tried to play with angle of cutting for different edges until i found the perfect looking angle and added a rotation to the e just to make things mroe fun.

## 'g' who said

After noticing how the Capital "G" is very small compared to the rest of the word, I made it a small 'g'.

## "G" is better

Finally, I stopped being lazy and made that g uppercase with a bigger size (and notice how i made the ending of the 'g' a bit longer).

## more smooth

I really didn't like those sharp edges, 'cus I was thinks about something more playful.

## Creating Color and Gradient Palletes

![As you can see a lot of colors and gradients](https://github.com/MrRamoun/google-homepage/blob/master/design/google%20logo%20redesign/%237%20-%20took%20me%208%20hours%20to%20pick%20those%20gradients%20and%20colors.png?raw=true "oh boy that took time")

> **Note**: It took me 8-10 hours to decide and pick between colors and gradients.

## Black is Gold

Let's try the logo with a black gradient and see how it looks

## Back to Original

I thought about trying the orginal "google" logo colors and that was the result.

## Finally (the final logo)

So i picked some cool gradients that look playful and cool at the same time because these are the vibes that I want.
